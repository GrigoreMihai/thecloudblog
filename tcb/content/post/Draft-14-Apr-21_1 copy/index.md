Lean Product Management is a methodology that covers the entire product life cycle from the idea to the withdrawal while providing the necessary practices, techniques, and tools to build successful products.

To succeed in product development, you have to change the perspective and move from valuing technology or the product to focusing on the business model. You have to understand that as entrepreneurs or product managers, you are not developing a product but a business model.
