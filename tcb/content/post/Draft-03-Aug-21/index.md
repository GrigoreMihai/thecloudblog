## Reusable APIs

1. Modern enterprise applications are built on an orchestration of a complex network of microservices.
2. As the organization evolves, the number of applications, the number of microservices and the complexity of orchestration increases.

Some considerations for building re-usable APIs:

1. Bespoke API development and management for each application takes a lot of time and effort.
2. Implementing cross cutting concerns such as security, logging, and monitoring consistently across services.
3. You have different databases that donâ€™t connect easily.

Benefits of reusing APIs:

1. Low number of services to manage.
2. Lower DevOps spend.
3. Higher security with lower attack surface.

Reusable APIs require a feature rich API platform that has in-built support for industry best practices of security, scalability, and monitoring. Without a feature rich API platform, your run the risk of applying uniform policies across services, and monitoring the services in a consistent manner. Also, since the services are serving multiple applications, every API can affect several applications.

## Solution: Kong Konnect

Kong provides three API proxy components that are used to manage and operate underlying services:

1. Ingress Controller: Inter-app connectivity in a Kubernetes environment.
2. Kong Mesh: In-app connectivity between services in Kubernetes or Cloud environment.
3. Gateway: Edge connectivity for services with clients.

Kong Konnect brings these services together on a single platform to provides visibility of the entire Kong environment and service catalog capabilities for every microservice managed by it.

Every component of the Kong platform defines 2 layers:

1. Control plane: capabilities to define API and policies e.g., authentication, rate limiting.
2. Data plane: control exposure of APIs with the policies defined in the control plane.

## Horizontal Concerns of Microservices

1. Enterprise policies: Autntication, Routing, Rate limiting, Logging, Monitoring, etc.
2. Security: Kong Auth plugins (https://docs.konghq.com/hub/) allows you to define policies for authentication and authorization of end users and services.
3. Communication: Request transformation plugins allow you to specify how the services can communicate in sync and async manner.
4. Deployment: Deploy Kong on your preferred Cloud.

## APIOps with ServiceHub

Allow developers to use Insomnia to define the API specs in a declarative way in Git. Enables operators and consumers to verify the specs and test the services to ensure that they meet their needs.

The ServiceHub provides a single source of truth for every service in the environment and enables developers to deploy new services using the same declarative code.

## Example: Pricing Service of an E-commerce App

Simple service that returns the price of a product based on the product ID.

## Step 1: Set up a Kong Konnect account

## Step 2: Generate Specs with Insomnia

## Step 3: Adding Authentication

## Step 4: Adding Rate Limiting

## Step 5: Logging to Loggly
