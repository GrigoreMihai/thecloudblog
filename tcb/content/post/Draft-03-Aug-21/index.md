Raise the need; Without an effective approach to the API lifecycle, the ability for your business to deliver its products - the APIs - will suffer.

What makes an API reusable? (I'm looking at this Kong post for this one)
well-designed, secured, and compliant
documented, discoverable, and accessible
performant, reliable, and scalable
(This is a quote from the referenced Kong post. Don't copy/paste this quote, but it's good to keep in mind: "Ensuring all of our services carry these properties, and are therefore consumable, is vital for reuse. The way to do this is by operationalizing and automating the service lifecycle with APIOps.")
