## The Problem

More than 75% businesses and 40% to 90% products fail or do not achive significant market adoption. There are five key mistakes that companies make that cause delay in time to market. Lean startup can avoid many of these mistakes and make customer experience better.

### Putting the Cart Before the Horse

Ask yourself: _What is the minimum experiment I can do to learn the most?_

Management should act like venture capitalists and use innovation accounting (choose key metrics that enable you to track and measure what really matters and use it to measure progress) until the product-market fit is reached.

Do not begin with an allocated budget for the year, scalable architecture, several developers until you have validated the product market fit.

### Build-Build-Build

Delivering software is the most expensive activity that you will perform, so try to reduce it as much as possible. Do not stick to the agile principle - "working software is the primary measure of progress". Validate your learning by asking the following questions:

- What problem is this solving?
- For whom? How many people?
- What are the alternatives currently available in the market?
- What should be the price for it to be profitable?
- Is our target customer willing to pay that price?
- What are the technological and operational implications of that price?

### Cognitive Biases

About 150 cognitive biases exist which can cause us to make irrational decisions due to automatisms in our brain.

Reduce the biases by iterating, implementing short feedback loops in contact with customers, and to using data to inform our decisions.

Important cognitive biases are:

1. **Innovator bias**: You fall in love with an idea/solution without validating whether there is a viable business model behind it. Step back and think whether you can build a profitable business model. Next, try to clearly differentiate your solution from the current solutions and competitors with a unique value proposition.
2. **Confirmation Bias**: People try to confirm their beliefs/hypothesis than giving weightage to evidence that can refute it. You will ignore evidence and work from belifs if you fall in this trap.
3. **Sunk Costs Fallacy**: If you have invested a lot of money, time and resources in a project, you will continue the project even if cancelling the project is the right decision from economic and rational point of view. Use Lean Startup, metrics, data, and short feedback loops in the product development process to avoid this problem.
